Analyze this codebase to generate or update `AGENTS.md` for guiding AI coding agents.

Focus on discovering the essential knowledge that would help an AI agents be immediately productive in this codebase.
Consider aspects like:

- The "big picture" architecture that requires reading multiple files to understand - major components, service
  boundaries, data flows, and the "why" behind structural decisions
- Critical developer workflows (builds, tests, debugging) especially commands that aren't obvious from file inspection
  alone
- Project-specific conventions and patterns that differ from common practices
- Integration points, external dependencies, and cross-component communication patterns

Source existing AI conventions from
`**/{.github/copilot-instructions.md,AGENT.md,AGENTS.md,CLAUDE.md,.cursorrules,.windsurfrules,.clinerules,.cursor/rules/**,.windsurf/rules/**,.clinerules/**,README.md}`
(do one glob search).

Guidelines

- If `AGENTS.md` exists, merge intelligently - preserve valuable content while updating outdated sections
- Write concise, actionable instructions (~20-50 lines) using markdown structure
- Include specific examples from the codebase when describing patterns
- Avoid generic advice ("write tests", "handle errors") - focus on THIS project's specific approaches
- Document only discoverable patterns, not aspirational practices
- Reference key files/directories that exemplify important patterns

use the write tool to write the `AGENTS.md` file for the user if empt.
