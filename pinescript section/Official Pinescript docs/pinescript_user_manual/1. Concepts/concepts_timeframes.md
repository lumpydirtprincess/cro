# [Timeframes](../1. Concepts/concepts_timeframes.md#timeframes)

## [Introduction](../1. Concepts/concepts_timeframes.md#introduction)

The _timeframe_ of a chart is sometimes also referred to as its
_interval_ or _resolution_. It is the unit of time represented by one
bar on the chart. All standard chart types use a timeframe: “Bars”,
“Candles”, “Hollow Candles”, “Line”, “Area” and “Baseline”.
One non-standard chart type also uses timeframes: “Heikin Ashi”.

Programmers interested in accessing data from multiple timeframes will
need to become familiar with how timeframes are expressed in Pine
Script®, and how to use them.

**Timeframe strings** come into play in different contexts:

- They must be used in
[request.security()](../../reference manual/functions/request.security.md)
when requesting data from another symbol and/or timeframe. See the
page on
[Other timeframes and data](../1. Concepts/concepts_other-timeframes-and-data.md) to explore the use of
[request.security()](../../reference manual/functions/request.security.md).
- They can be used as an argument to
[time()](../../reference manual/functions/time.md)
and
[time\_close()](../../reference manual/functions/time_close.md)
functions, to return the time of a higher timeframe bar. This, in
turn, can be used to detect changes in higher timeframes from the
chart’s timeframe without using
[request.security()](../../reference manual/functions/request.security.md).
See the
[Testing for changes in higher timeframes](../1. Concepts/concepts_time.md#testing-for-changes-in-higher-timeframes) section to see how to do this.
- The
[input.timeframe()](../../reference manual/functions/input.timeframe.md)
function provides a way to allow script users to define a timeframe
through a script’s “Inputs” tab (see the
[Timeframe input](../1. Concepts/concepts_inputs.md#timeframe-input) section for more information).
- The
[indicator()](../../reference manual/functions/indicator.md)
declaration statement has an optional `timeframe` parameter that can
be used to provide multi-timeframe capabilities to simple scripts
without using
[request.security()](../../reference manual/functions/request.security.md).
- Many built-in variables provide information on the timeframe used by
the chart the script is running on. See the
[Chart timeframe](../1. Concepts/concepts_chart-information.md#chart-timeframe) section for more information on them, including
[timeframe.period](../../reference manual/variables/timeframe.period.md)
which returns a string in Pine Script’s timeframe specification
format.

## [Timeframe string specifications](../1. Concepts/concepts_timeframes.md#timeframe-string-specifications)

Timeframe strings follow these rules:

- They are composed of the multiplier and the timeframe unit, e.g.,
“1S”, “30” (30 minutes), “1D” (one day), “3M” (three
months).

- The unit is represented by a single letter, with no letter used for
minutes: “T” for ticks, “S” for seconds, “D” for days, “W” for weeks, and
“M” for months.

- When no multiplier is used, 1 is assumed: “S” is equivalent to
“1S”, “D” to “1D”, etc. If only “1” is used, it is interpreted
as 1 minute, since no unit letter identifier is used for minutes.

- There is no “hour” unit; “1H” is **not** valid. The correct
format for one hour is “60” (remember no unit letter is specified
for minutes).

- The valid multipliers vary for each timeframe unit:
  - For ticks, only the discrete 1, 10, 100, and 1000 multipliers are valid.
  - For seconds, only the discrete 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 multipliers are valid.
  - For minutes, 1 to 1440.
  - For days, 1 to 365.
  - For weeks, 1 to 52.
  - For months, 1 to 12.

## [Comparing timeframes](../1. Concepts/concepts_timeframes.md#comparing-timeframes)

It can be useful to compare different timeframe strings to determine,
for example, if the timeframe used on the chart is lower than the higher
timeframes used in the script.

Converting timeframe strings to a representation in fractional minutes
provides a way to compare them using a universal unit. This script uses
the
[timeframe.in\_seconds()](../../reference manual/functions/timeframe.in_seconds.md)
function to convert a timeframe into float seconds and then converts the
result into minutes:

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Timeframe in minutes example", "", true)
string tfInput = input.timeframe(defval = "", title = "Input TF")

float chartTFInMinutes = timeframe.in_seconds() / 60
float inputTFInMinutes = timeframe.in_seconds(tfInput) / 60

var table t = table.new(position.top_right, 1, 1)
string txt = "Chart TF: "    + str.tostring(chartTFInMinutes, "#.##### minutes") +
"\nInput TF: " + str.tostring(inputTFInMinutes, "#.##### minutes")
if barstate.isfirst
    table.cell(t, 0, 0, txt, bgcolor = color.yellow)
else if barstate.islast
    table.cell_set_text(t, 0, 0, txt)

if chartTFInMinutes > inputTFInMinutes
    runtime.error("The chart's timeframe must not be higher than the input's timeframe.")
```

Note that:

- We use the built-in [timeframe.in\_seconds()](../../reference manual/functions/timeframe.in_seconds.md) function to convert the chart timeframe and the timeframe selected by the user into seconds, then divide by 60 to convert into minutes.
- We use two calls to the
[timeframe.in\_seconds()](../../reference manual/functions/timeframe.in_seconds.md)
function in the initialization of the `chartTFInMinutes` and
`inputTFInMinutes` variables. In the first instance, we do not
supply an argument for its `timeframe` parameter, so the function
returns the chart’s timeframe in seconds. In the second call, we
supply the timeframe selected in the
[timeframe input](../1. Concepts/concepts_inputs.md#timeframe-input).
- Next, we validate the timeframes to ensure that the input timeframe
is equal to or higher than the chart’s timeframe. If it is not, the script
generates a custom runtime error.
- We finally print the two timeframe values converted to minutes.
