## 🗺️ Learning Path

If you're new to this collection, read in this order:

1. **[`LEARNING_GUIDE.md`](LEARNING_GUIDE.md)** — Start here. Structured walkthrough of every master-level pattern used across the codebase: custom types, libraries, arrays, footprint data, z-scoring, Hurst exponent, DSP filters, neural networks in Pine, Thompson Sampling, and more. All examples are drawn directly from these files.

2. **[`safe cuz lib.pine`](<safe cuz lib.pine>)** — Read the library first. It shows the cleanest, most teachable examples of `export type`, `export` functions, theme systems, and statistical helpers.

3. **[`MA-trix Laboratory `](<MA-trix Laboratory >)** — A self-contained indicator. See how 55+ algorithms are organized with `input.string` option arrays, tooltip groups, and adaptive filters.

4. **[`BandsandChannelsLaboratory.pine`](BandsandChannelsLaboratory.pine)** and **[`RSI: Evolved [DAFE].pine`](<RSI: Evolved [DAFE].pine>)** — Study the modular algorithm selection pattern and multi-mode signal architecture.

5. **[`WHF - Wave Health and Failure v6`](<WHF - Wave Health and Failure v6>)** — Introduces library imports (`import DskyzInvestments/...`), ML engine, and Thompson Sampling.

6. **[`Riemannian_Dreamer_Manifold_Engine.pine`](Riemannian_Dreamer_Manifold_Engine.pine)** — The flagship. Differential geometry, Hurst-modulated pivots, footprint integration, RL world model, GRPO policy optimization.
